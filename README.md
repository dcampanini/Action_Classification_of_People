# Action Classification of People

This is the project of my second internship, at the Computer Vision Laboratory of the University of Chile. In this work, I write the code to use the system of action classification developed Georgia Gkioxari et al. in the paper "R-CNNs for Pose Estimation and Action Detection"

# Description of the system for action detection 

# Dataset
The system was training and testing in  PASCAL VOC 2012 action dataset. There are in total 10 different actions: jumping, phoning, playing instrument, reading, riding bike, riding horse, running, taking photo, using computer and walking. The next images are a sample of the cite dataset
